===================
"Go to date"-Zimlet
===================

************
Introduction
************

This zimlet listens for the hotkey STRG-SHIFT-G and pops up a date selection 
box. The user can either choose a date using a mini calendar or manually enter 
the date.

After clicking OK, the calendar application is activated and the specified 
date is shown.

This is much faster than using the arrow-buttons in the calendar application.

Installation
************

Use the Zimbra Web Console or the zmzimletctl-CLI tool to install this zimlet.
